## Notes:
- the data is generated -> can we re-verse engineer the data generation process?
   -> or: what are the tytpical features considered for modelling this?
   -> additionally: there must be some variable, even if it is whitheld that informs if a transaction is fraudulent or not -> what would i use if i where to generate such a dataset?
- 15% fraudsters -> any model that we can use thresholding with should have an according threshold
    -> potentially the organisers used different percentages for train/val/test 


## Understandings:
- The fraudulent percentage differs between the datasets (train is mostly between 10-15% per action, val ranges from 3-15% per action, test is obviously unclear)


## Log:
- read desrciption and added some thoughts
- plot data
